# coprintf #

Colorful printf for C Code ( ascii color only )

----------

## Overview ##

A **light** wrapper of `printf`, with color flags of **foreground**, **background** and **action** ( highlight, underline, blink ... ) . With it, you can easily colorize your output of command and shell script.

## Install ##

Before use `coprintf`, simply include the header in your files like this: `#include "coprintf.h"`

## Usage ##

Support multi-string in one command:

	coprintf("<leader>rHello <leader>bWorld");

Support stdout and stderr:

	coprintf("<leader>rHello <leader>bWorld");

	ceprintf("<leader>rHello <leader>bWorld");

Support setting foreground, background and action

	coprintf("<leader>r<leader>YHello <leader>b<leader>CWorld");

Support switch the printf status:

	#define CO_PRINTF_ACTIVE	1		--->		colorful output

	#define CO_PRINTF_ACTIVE	0		--->		normal output

#### Leader Character ####

We define a character as the <leader> character, who will combine the mode character as escape character.

The default option is **"^"**, you can customize it to any char you want, before calling coprintf.

The mode control formats are easily memorized:

	Foreground : **almost** the lowercase of color mode head, "black" is exceptive.
	
	Background : **almost** the uppercase of color mode head, "black" is exceptive.

	Controling : **almost** the lowercase of mode head, with some exceptions.

#### Foreground color flag ##

| mode		| color  |
| --------- | ------ |
| <leader>k | black  |
| <leader>r | red    |
| <leader>g | green  |
| <leader>y | yellow |
| <leader>b | blue   |
| <leader>p | purple |
| <leader>c | cyan   |
| <leader>w | write  |

#### Background color flag ####

| mode      | color  |
| --------- | ------ |
| <leader>K | black  |
| <leader>R | red    |
| <leader>G | green  |
| <leader>Y | yellow |
| <leader>B | blue   |
| <leader>P | purple |
| <leader>C | cyan   |
| <leader>W | write  |

#### Action flag ####

| mode		| action    |
| --------- | --------- |
| <leader>d | done      |
| <leader>h | highlight |
| <leader>u | underline |
| <leader>e | reverse   |
| <leader>l | blink     |
| <leader>v | invisible |

## Example (use default leader '^' ) ##

##### set fg to red: #####
	
	coprintf("^r%s","hello world !");

or

	coprintf("^rhello world !");

##### set fg to red, bg to yellow, action to highlight and underline: #####

	coprintf("^r^Y^h^u%s","hello world !");

##### set [ red, yellow, highlight & underline ] for "hello", [ cyan, red, reverse ] for "world", [ green, black, blink ] for "!" : #####

	coprintf("^r^Y^h^u%shello^d ^c^R^eworld^d ^g^K^l!");

**More examples in demo.c**

## Advanced ##

- Action flag `<leader>d` will **turn off all settings** ( fg, bg and action ), Thus, in **single** command, you have to set flags again to make it work well once there are other strings after `<leader>d`.
- If you want to print the leader itself, try `<leader><leader>`; If the char after leader isn't defined as an escape char, it will be ignored.
- It's **not** necessary use `<leader>d` at the begin/end of commands, `coprintf` do it automatically.
- Actions can overlaied.

## What's more ##

This project is really same as [cecho](https://github.com/springlie/cecho), which supports similar functions to `echo` in shell script. Yes, `coprintf` is just the C version of `cecho`!
